## Udacity NANODEGREE PROGRAM : AI for Trading

### Term 1. Quantitative Trading

- Project 1: Trading with Momentum.
  [In this project I learned to implement a trading strategy and tested for potential profit.](https://github.com/rbpal/01-qt-project-01-trading-with-momentum)

- Project 2: Breakout Strategy.
  [Implemented the breakout strategy, found and removed outliers, and tested for profit potential using Histogram and P-Value.](https://github.com/rbpal/01-qt-project-02-breakout-strategy)

- Project 3: Smart Beta and Portfolio Optimization.
  [Build a smart beta portfolio against an index and optimize a portfolio using quadratic programming.](https://github.com/rbpal/01-qt-project-03-smart-beta-portfolio-optimization)

- Project 4: Alpha Research and Factor Modeling.
  [Researched and implemented alpha factors, built a risk factor model. Used alpha factors and risk factors to optimize a portfolio.](https://github.com/rbpal/01-qt-project-04-apha-research-factor-modeling)



### Term 2. AI Algorithms in Trading (AIAT)
